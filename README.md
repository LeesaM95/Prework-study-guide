# Prework-study-guide
## Description

I created a webpage to showcase notes I've taken through the entire pre-work course. I wanted to understand how each component (HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript) worked individually and then together to create a cohesive site. I built this project to familiarize with the process and tools I'll be using both within my class and in my professional career. 

This project solves the problem of where I would keep my notes. Paper notes are nice, but easily ruined by a myriad of outside factors, including time, spilled liquids, young children, animals, and my own forgetfulness. Having a study guide available to me online not only keeps them safe from harm, but also allows me to add to these notes on the fly and as I see fit, creating a more cohesive study guide as I go. It will also allow me to continuously practice my skills and perhaps even update the guide to my specifications in the future. 

I learned about Git and Gitbash, how to create an account, use the application, and the commands needed to update my work, and the basic structures of HTML and CSS and how they interlock and integrate with each other. I also learned about JavaScript and how it works, including the 'if' and 'for' loops, as well as creating variables and functions. It's still rather difficult for me to wrap my head around, but the basic knowledge will aid me in the future.

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, navigate through the site to review each note section. If you're stuck on what to study first, open the ChromeDev tools (either using the Command+Option+I for MacOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows). Click on the 'console' panel that appears either on the side or below the webpage and that should show the list of topics available to study that we learned during Prework. Feel free to follow along with the suggestion added on what to study first if you're still stuck.
